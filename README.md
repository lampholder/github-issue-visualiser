# github-issue-visualiser
A greasemonkey script that pulls in the status (open/close) of linked issues in comments and enhances the link.

Click <a href="https://github.com/lampholder/github-issue-visualiser/raw/master/github_issue_visualiser.user.js">here</a> to install it (you need to have Grease/TamperMonkey installed).

It pulls in the project column status if it has one, otherwise falls back to open/closed; it looks like this:
