# github-issue-visualiser
~~A greasemonkey script that pulls in the status (open/close) of linked issues in comments and enhances the link.~~

It's now three greasemonkey scripts, all providing an enanced view on Github, mostly driven by Github's embryonic and poorly-integrated projects/kanban board business.

1. Install Grease/TamperMonkey
1. Install the [Github issue status visualiser](https://github.com/lampholder/github-issue-visualiser/raw/master/github_issue_visualiser.user.js) to enhance references to issues in comments with either their open/clos√®dness or their kanban column name if available. It looks like this:

1. Install the [Github project moreseeabliser](https://github.com/lampholder/github-issue-visualiser/raw/master/github_issue_project_moreseeabliser.user.js) to promote an issue's association with a project to be much more visually obvious (stuffs the project name in the issue title and puts the status alongside the existing open/closed marker)
1. Install the [Github project description includer](https://github.com/lampholder/github-issue-visualiser/raw/master/github_project_description_includer.user.js) to put the project description next to the project name on the project page (this one is hardcoded to Matrix/Vector stuff at the moment; sorry)
